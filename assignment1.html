        <h1>MY TECHNOLOGY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <h2>A GROWING RELIANCE</h2>
        <p>It seems impossible to imagine a world without technology; after all, 
        we have come a long way and advanced technologically since the beginning 
        of time. Everywhere people look, they find smartphones, computers, tablets, 
        flatscreen TVs, digital music — the list goes on. Having been surrounded by 
        technology since a young age, I never took a moment to stop and think about 
        my relationship with it. Personally, technology was nothing more than a form 
        of entertainment for me. However, this particular use of electronic devices 
        such as computers and laptops soon changed to help with productivity. While 
        my experience with technology evolved into something different in some ways, 
        one fact still remains: my reliance on it never faded away.</p>

        <p>My earliest memory of using digital technologies goes way back to when I 
        was in preschool. Every day when my dad dropped me off at the entrance of the 
        building, I would give him a quick hug before running past the bookshelves and 
        plastic toy bins to play games on the computers. While I only vaguely recall 
        the kind of games the computers had loaded onto them, I believe my favorite one 
        had to do with cooking. One part of the game included a refrigerator where the 
        player could choose which ingredients to cook. At the end, a rabbit character 
        would appear and eat whatever dish was prepared.</p>

        <p>Thinking back on this early personal experience with technology makes me 
        feel incredibly nostalgic and remember all the other older forms of digital 
        technology. Although today’s technology is far more advanced and diverse than 
        it was back then, I still miss the old box TVs, computer games, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Nano" target="_blank">iPod Nanos</a>, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy" target="_blank">Game Boys</a>, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube" target="_blank">Game Cubes</a>, and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation" target="_blank">Playstations</a> 
        that were considered cool. I can vividly recall my younger self playing solitaire and 
        pinball on my family’s PC in the basement after begging my parents. I was not great 
        at playing solitaire, but the undo button became my best friend as I used it constantly 
        until I was able to see the decks of cards bounce across the screen as colored fireworks 
        indicated my victory.</p>

        <p>Looking in the past, I like to believe that my relationship with technology has 
        changed or matured for the better, yet another part of me disagrees with this statement. 
        It is definitely true that I have grown out of playing computer games, using gaming 
        gadgets, and surprisingly — watching TV, but I still find myself surrounded by digital 
        technology for different purposes. For one thing, school work now requires the use of 
        some form of technology, such as a computer or laptop to access online websites and 
        assignments. And with the ongoing pandemic, I was surrounded by digital technology to 
        the point where I grew tired of it. Whether it was attending online classes through 
        <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a>, using applications like 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> or 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for 
        assignments, or using my phone for an additional three hours a day out of pure boredom, 
        my life during this period of time was never short on technology. To this day, I still 
        find myself looking down at my phone for unnecessary amounts of time. Aside from using 
        my phone for well-deserved downtime, I sometimes notice myself mindlessly scrolling through 
        social media posts on platforms like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>; it seems as if I feel 
        obliged to constantly be on my phone or using some sort of technology to keep myself busy. 
        In fact, if I was to compare the time I currently spend using digital technology versus back 
        then, it would probably be greater today.</p>

        <p>Although my use of digital technology can be a little excessive at times, I still believe 
        that being technologically literate and knowing how to use various forms of technology is 
        important and necessary in the contemporary world. Not only does technology provide convenience 
        through quick and easy access to information, but it helps individuals stay connected by providing 
        a mode of communication. Whether it is emails, text messages, or video calls, people are only one 
        touch away from contacting a friend, family, or coworker. In addition, technology can provide people 
        with different sets of skills, such as navigating computers, coding software, creating digital content, 
        and so much more. Ultimately, the world we live in today would not be what it is without the use of 
        digital technology.</p>
